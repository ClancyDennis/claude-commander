Claude Commander helps you get things done using AI assistants called "helpers."

## What can helpers do?
- **Organize and manage files** - Sort, rename, move files
- **Write and edit code** - Create features, fix bugs
- **Create documentation** - README files, comments, guides
- **Review your work** - Code review, suggestions

## How it works
1. Create a helper by clicking the + button
2. Tell it what you want done
3. Watch it work in real-time
4. Chat to adjust if needed

## Key concepts
- **Helper**: An AI assistant working on your task
- **Working Directory**: The folder where the helper operates
- **Pipeline**: Multiple helpers working together
